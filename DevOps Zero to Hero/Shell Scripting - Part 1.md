## Interview Question
If we are able to create a file using - touch command, and then user vi to create and open the file, or directly use vi to create and open the file, then what is the use of touch commmand?

Answer: 
Touch command is used in automations, Vim is used to wirte inside the file, but for automations we need touch command to create a file, we dont need it to be opened, and we will be having some thousands of files, for which when we automate - we cannot use the command vi file_name, as in automation it will create 1000 files, and opens 1000 files, which can make the system hang.

INSERT

#!/  --- this is called shebang

#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/dash
#!/bin/ksh
#!/bin/sh

--- the above is the first line in any shell script -- these are different executables of our shell script


Linking:

#!/bin/sh ----> redirects to #!/bin/bash, this is called linking (this is done previously - may be around 2 years ago)

these days ---> some of the operating systems like Ubuntu, they have started linking -> #!/bin/sh to #!/bin/dash

so, if you want to use bash, directly write like this:   #!/bin/bash, instead of using #!/bin/sh, since sh is linked to dash, not bash


## Interview Question:  

What is the difference between #!/bin/sh and #!/bin/bash?

Answer: previously both are same as #!/bin/sh is redirected to #!/bin/bash, however in recent years, #!/bin/sh is redirected to #!/bin/dash, so our script might not execute if we use bash scripting where dash is default.

Linux Command to grant permissions:

chmod -> grants permissions


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4817b10-1c96-4e6b-b738-bbe6ac57a4a6)


chmod - is divided into 3 categories:
-> what are permission for admin user?
-> what are permissions to the group?
-> what are permission for you?


chmod 777 first-shell-script.sh -> this means granting the access to eveybody, now you can execute the file:

# Purpose of Shell Scripting in DevOps


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4be10b9-1efb-46a6-a402-93781fbc7fef)

In DevOps we use shell scripts for:
1) Infrastructure maintenance
2) Code in Git (which we use Linux)
3) Configuration Management (Ansible) - In order to go to the machine and the folder where Ansible scripts are present we use shell scripts to go there.

# Interview Question:

Why are you using shell scripting?

Answer:  You can say - I have automated, all the Node Health of my VM's, we have some 1000 VM's, everytime it is difficult to monitor the Node Health or Status of this Virtual Machine, so I decided to write a script, then the next question:
there are some automated tools, why you are using this shell scripting? 
Answer: You can say - In our organization we are not using such tools, or say that - these tools are restricted from generating some parameters, only a restricted number of parameters, In my script I am fetching more parameters, which are not provided by those tools.

# Interview Question:

How do you monitor the Node Health?
Answer: by using Top Command, or I can write the custom shell scripts

# Interview Question:

What are the parameters that are used to monitor Node Health?
Answer: Some basic parameters are: CPU and RAM
