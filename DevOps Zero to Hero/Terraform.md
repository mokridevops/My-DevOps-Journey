# Advantages of Terraform:

1) Manage any infrastructure : AWS, AZURE, GCP, Open Stack, Oracle Cloud

2) Track your infrastructure:

login to Terraform - and check State file - it could be stored in S3 bucket, etc - thenyou can see all the resources that were created

3) Automate changes:

you can automate, instead of login to AWS 

put the terraform files, except state files in GIT, and 

4) collaborate with your peers

5) Standardize configurations - we maintain standards - for all the cloud providers
