# Docker Bind Mounts & Volumes

Problem with container:
1) If container goes down, the files that were generated like log files, all are gone, and you cannot access them

2) Suppose if we have two containers,  if the files generated by the backend containers that are usually accessed by the front end container , however if back end container is down,  when frontend container is searchign for the files, only todays file are accessible, all the previous ones are gone, as once the backend container came back, it generated today's file.

3) Suppose if a cron job is generating files on the host operating system, and the application on the container needs to access it, it is not possible

   1) Bind Mounts - allows to bind a directory inside a container, with a folder on the host:
  
      what ever is written on container - will be saved on host folder also
   2) Volumes:  using docker CLI - create volumes, destroy, remove from container C1 and add it to container C2.
  
      Volumes has life cycle: create, destroy, use it etc

      Volumes are better - you can create on: host machine, EC2, S3, NFS -> take external backups
      Volumes are very high performance
