SVN - is centralized version control system, if the Central Version control server goes down, then there won't be any communication between the two developers who are working on the same code.


In distributed version control system - you can copy the central distributed system and make multiple copies

# Interview Question:

# What is a fork?

Fork is nothing but, you create an entire copy of your original source, 


for ex: example.com

you creating a copy of example.com, where Abhishek is the name of my git repository.

Fork Abhishek, will create a copy of the git repository, if the main repository is down, then also the developers can communicate and share the code since they have the copy of the repo.
