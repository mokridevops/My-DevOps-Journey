Configuration Management is a way - how devops engineer manages the configuration of the infrastructure

earlier - before Ansible, what system admins used to to is:

suppose if there are 100 servers that needs to be upgraded or install secure patches or do some git or any other software installation:
the used to write scripts:

shell scripting - if it is unix box
Powersheel - if it is windows box

and they have to counter in all possibilities such as:

25 machines are windows
25 machines are linux
25 machines are centOS
25 machines are Ubuntu

after that the entire configuration was moved to cloud:

with cloud the number of server getting created were : 10X

while the size of the server has shrinked down by 10X

so there is a definite need for a tool to solve this problem
